The great majority of fibers connecting the two hemispheres travel through the corpus callosum, which is over 10 times larger than the anterior commissure, and other routes of communication pass through the hippocampal commissure or, indirectly, via subcortical connections.  Nevertheless, the anterior commissure is a significant pathway that can be clearly distinguished in the brains of all mammals.

The anterior commissure plays a key role in pain sensation, more specifically sharp, acute pain.  It also contains decussating fibers from the olfactory tracts, vital for the sense of smell and chemoreception.  The anterior commissure works with the posterior commissure to link the two cerebral hemispheres of the brain and also interconnects the amygdalae and temporal lobes, contributing to the role of memory, emotion, speech and hearing.  It also is involved in olfaction, instinct, and sexual behavior.

DecliveCerebellumThe cerebellum (Latin for \"little brain\") is a major feature of the hindbrain of all vertebrates.  Although usually smaller than the cerebrum, in some animals such as the mormyrid fishes it may be as large as or even larger. In humans, the cerebellum plays an important role in motor control. It may also be involved in some cognitive functions such as attention and language as well as in regulating fear and pleasure responses, but its movement-related functions are the most solidly established. The human cerebellum does not initiate movement, but contributes to coordination, precision, and accurate timing: it receives input from sensory systems of the spinal cord and from other parts of the brain, and integrates these inputs to fine-tune motor activity. Cerebellar damage produces disorders in fine movement, equilibrium, posture, and motor learning in humans.Anatomically, the human cerebellum has the appearance of a separate structure attached to the bottom of the brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.In addition to its direct role in motor control, the cerebellum is necessary for several types of motor learning, most notably learning to adjust to changes in sensorimotor relationships. Several theoretical models have been developed to explain sensorimotor calibration in terms of synaptic plasticity within the cerebellum. These models derive from those formulated by David Marr and James Albus, based on the observation that each cerebellar Purkinje cell receives two dramatically different types of input: one comprises thousands of weak inputs from the parallel fibers of the granule cells; the other is an extremely strong input from a single climbing fiber. The basic concept of the Marr–Albus theory is that the climbing fiber serves as a \"teaching signal\", which induces a long-lasting change in the strength of parallel fiber inputs. Observations of long-term depression in parallel fiber inputs have provided support for theories of this type, but their validity remains controversial."

Humans and other mammals have two hippocampi, one in each side of the brain. The hippocampus belongs to the limbic system and plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory, and in spatial memory that enables navigation. The hippocampus is located under the cerebral cortex (allocortical) and in primates in the medial temporal lobe. It contains two main interlocking parts:  the hippocampus proper (also called Ammon's horn)  and the dentate gyrus.

In Alzheimer's disease (and other forms of dementia), the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to suffer damage; short-term memory loss and disorientation are included among the early symptoms. Damage to the hippocampus can also result from oxygen starvation (hypoxia), encephalitis, or medial temporal lobe epilepsy.  People with extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage may experience anterograde amnesia (the inability to form and retain new memories).

In rodents as model organisms, the hippocampus has been studied extensively as part of a brain system responsible for spatial memory and navigation.  Many neurons in the rat and mouse hippocampus respond as place cells:  that is, they fire bursts of action potentials when the animal passes through a specific part of its environment.  Hippocampal place cells interact extensively with head direction cells, whose activity acts as an inertial compass, and conjecturally with grid cells in the neighboring entorhinal cortex.

Since different neuronal cell types are neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently been used as a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was first discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed to be one of the main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain."

The GPe GABAergic neurons, allow for its inhibitory function and projects axons to the subthalamic nucleus (in the diencephalon), the striatum, internal globus pallidus (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata.The GPe is particular in comparison to the other elements of the set by the fact that it does not work as an output base of the basal ganglia (not sending axons to the thalamus) but as the main regulator of the basal ganglia system.  It is sometimes used as a target for deep brain stimulation as a treatment for Parkinson's disease."

Transverse Temporal Gyrus,"-50.3863  21.7322  11.5","<img src='Right_Transverse_Temporal_Gyrus.axi.jpg'/>","<img src='Right_Transverse_Temporal_Gyrus.sag.jpg'/>","<img src='Right_Transverse_Temporal_Gyrus.cor.jpg'/>","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_temporal_gyrus","The transverse temporal gyri, also called Heschl's gyri () or Heschl's convolutions, are found in the area of primary auditory cortex buried within the lateral sulcus of the human brain, occupying Brodmann areas 41 & 42. Transverse temporal gyri are superior to and are separated from the planum temporale (cortex involved in language production) by Heschl’s sulcus. Transverse temporal gyri are found in varying numbers in both the right and left hemispheres of the brain, and one study found that this number is not related to the hemisphere or dominance of hemisphere studied in subjects. Transverse temporal gyri can be viewed in the saggital plane as either an omega shape (if one gyrus is present) or a heart shape (if two gyri and a sulcus are present).Transverse temporal gyri are the first cortical structures to process incoming auditory information. Anatomically, the transverse temporal gyri are distinct in that they run mediolaterally (towards the center of the brain), rather than front to back as all other temporal lobe gyri run.

The transverse temporal gyri are active during auditory processing under fMRI for tone and semantic tasks. Transverse temporal gyri were found in one study to have significantly faster processing rates (33 Hz) in the left hemisphere compared to those in the right hemisphere (3 Hz). Additionally this difference in processing rate was found to be related to the volume of rate-related cortex in the gyri; right transverse temporal gryi were found to be more active during temporal processing, and these gryi were found to have more “rate-related cortex”. White and grey matter volumes of transverse temporal gyri were not found to relate to this processing speed, although larger white matter volumes in subjects are associated with increased sensitivity to “rapid auditory input”.The role of transverse temporal gyri in auditory processing of tone is demonstrated by a study by Wong, Warrier et. al. (2008). This study revealed the following: subjects that could successfully form an association between Mandarin Chinese “pitch patterns” and word meaning were found to have transverse temporal gyri with larger volume than subjects who had “difficulty learning these associations.” Successful completion of the previous task was also found to be associated with a “greater concentration of white matter” in the left transverse temporal gyri of the subject. In general, larger transverse temporal gyri “could be associated with more efficient processing of speech-related cues which could facilitate learning and perceiving new speech sounds.”The Heschl's gyri are named after Richard L. Heschl."

Stem tubers form from thickened rhizomes (underground stems) or stolons (horizontal connections between organisms). Common plant species with stem tubers include potato and yam.
